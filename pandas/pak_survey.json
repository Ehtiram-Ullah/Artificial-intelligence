Stakeholder groups which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents who belonged to the ?other? stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY?21 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C and E. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix D (page 81) of the report provided as external resources.","description":" <strong>Series Name</strong>: Country Opinion Survey <br><br> <strong>Series Info</strong>: The World Bank Group Country Opinion Survey Program systematically measures and tracks the perceptions of the World Bank Group?s clients, partners, and other stakeholders across the globe in client countries.
